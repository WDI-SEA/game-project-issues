#GAME PROJECT ISSUES!

If you're having trouble with your game, fear not! Open an issue on this repository, and follow the template to leave a detailed comment about your issue, an instructor will get respond back to you, and attempt to give you all the help you need! If your problem can't be resolved in a timely fashion through issue replies, we'll escalate to a zoom 1:1.

Happy Coding!
